You created an Instagram Bot functionality app using Python modules, 
enabling automated interactions on Instagram, such as liking, commenting,
following, and unfollowing accounts. This bot likely utilizes web scraping and
automation libraries such as Selenium or Instagram's API to perform actions on behalf of
the user. The app could help manage accounts, increase engagement, and streamline repetitive tasks,
saving time for Instagram users or businesses.
